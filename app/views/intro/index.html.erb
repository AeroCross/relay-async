<h2 class="text-center">Hi!</h2>
<p class="text-center mute">Thank you <strong>very</strong> much for helping me out with my dissertation.</p>

<div class="text-justify">
  <p>My name is Mario and I am pursuing a MSc. in Information Systems with Computing in Dublin, Ireland. I am using this site as a tool to research the effect that hybrid support systems have in customer experience and satisfaction — and in this case, <strong>you</strong> are the customer, and I need you to help me out!</p>

  <p>This will only take a few minutes of your time and you'll make someone you don't know very happy. Consider this your good deed of the day.</p>

  <h4>Instructions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><%= link_to 'Submit a new ticket here', submit_path %> with anything you can think of.
      <ul>
        <li>It can be a simple request, a question about literally <em>anything</em>, or just casual conversation. Just
          be sure you use a valid email address so you can get notifications.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><%= link_to 'Check your ticket', history_path %> and add anything else you'd like there.
      <ul>
        <li>It's good to know that everything was saved correctly and to learn how to check how the conversation's going.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Wait for me to get back to you, then let the conversation begin!
      <ul>
        <li>You will receive further instructions in my replies on how to use the live chat (if I am available) or the regular system. It's a couple of clicks tops!</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="https://aerocross.typeform.com/to/UG8hqA">Fill the survey</a> after the conversation is over so I can get your feedback.</li>

  </ol>

  <p><strong>That's it!</strong> Thank you very much — and if I may say, your hair looks epic today and you smell like a meadow.</p>
