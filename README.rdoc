# Relay: Async

A simple ticketing system based in Rails 4 that interacts with a Node.js-based live chat. **Not production ready**.

This project will eventually evolve into a fully-fledged application, but in the meantime, it's just a research project for my MSc. and a playground to learn rails.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository into your server
2. Run `bundler install`
3. Configure the database
3. Run `rake db:migrate` to set up everything
4. Start the server

This does not need any other application to function properly, but it can use [Relay: Sync](http://github.com/AeroCross/relay-sync) for live chat. More information in the repository.

### Gems used

- Faker
- Bootstrap-Rails

Any bugs, questions, or anything, let me know.
